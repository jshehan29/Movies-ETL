# Movies ETL

## Movies ETL Overview

In this project, ETL was performed on three files containing movie data. Two CSV files and one JSON file were imported using Jupyter Notebook, the relevant data was extracted, transformed, and loaded into a PostreSQL database in preparation for a hackathon for the company Amazing Prime. The analysis code was developed in Python using Pandas data frames and matplotlib to visualize relationships between datasets. The data was exported to a PostgreSQL database using Python, and queries were performed to verify successful data export.
